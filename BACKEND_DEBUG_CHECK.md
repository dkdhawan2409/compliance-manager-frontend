# üîç Backend Debug Check

## Issue Analysis from Screenshot

From the screenshot, I can see:
1. **Xero Error**: "unauthorized_client - Invalid redirect_uri - Error code: 500"
2. **Network Tab**: Shows "Failed to load response data" and "No resource with given identifier found"
3. **Request**: `https://compliance-manager-backend.onrender.com/api/xero/settings`

## Possible Issues:

### 1. **Backend Not Responding**
- The backend might be down or not responding
- Network request is failing to load response data

### 2. **Redirect URI Mismatch**
- The redirect URI in your Xero app doesn't match what we're sending
- Backend might be using a different redirect URI than what we're sending

### 3. **Backend Configuration**
- Backend might have hardcoded localhost redirect URIs
- Backend environment variables might be incorrect

## Debug Steps:

### Step 1: Check Backend Health
```bash
curl https://compliance-manager-backend.onrender.com/api/health
```

### Step 2: Test Backend Xero Endpoint
```bash
curl "https://compliance-manager-backend.onrender.com/api/xero/login?redirect_uri=https://compliance-manager-frontend.onrender.com/redirecturl&state=test123"
```

### Step 3: Check Backend Logs
- Check Render backend logs for any errors
- Look for redirect URI mismatches

### Step 4: Verify Xero App Configuration
- Go to Xero Developer Portal
- Check that your app has EXACTLY this redirect URI:
  ```
  https://compliance-manager-frontend.onrender.com/redirecturl
  ```
- Remove any localhost redirect URIs

## Expected Backend Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "authUrl": "https://login.xero.com/identity/connect/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=...&redirect_uri=https://compliance-manager-frontend.onrender.com/redirecturl&scope=...&state=..."
  }
}
```

## If Backend is Using Wrong Redirect URI:
The backend might be:
1. Hardcoded to use localhost
2. Using environment variables that point to localhost
3. Not using the redirect_uri parameter we're sending

## Next Steps:
1. Use the new Debug Panel to see exactly what's happening
2. Check backend logs on Render
3. Verify Xero app configuration
4. Test backend endpoints directly
