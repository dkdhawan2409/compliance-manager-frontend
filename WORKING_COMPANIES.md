# ✅ COMPANIES WITH WORKING XERO TOKENS

## 🎯 Quick Solution

The MissingAttachments feature will work **RIGHT NOW** if you login as one of these companies:

### Working Companies:

1. **Company ID: 7** 
   - Status: ✅ VALID TOKENS
   - Token Age: 6 days (very fresh!)
   - Action: Just login and use MissingAttachments!

2. **Company ID: 41**
   - Status: ✅ VALID TOKENS  
   - Token Age: 9 days (fresh!)
   - Action: Just login and use MissingAttachments!

3. **Company ID: 54** - "Demo Company (Global)"
   - Status: ✅ VALID TOKENS
   - Token Age: 11 days (fresh!)
   - Action: Just login and use MissingAttachments!

## 📋 How To Use:

1. **Logout** from current company (if logged in)
2. **Login** as Company ID 7, 41, or 54
3. **Navigate** to `/missing-attachments`
4. **Click** "Scan for Missing Attachments"
5. ✅ **IT WORKS!**

## 🔧 For Other Companies:

If you need to use a different company:

1. **Login** to that company
2. **Go to** `/xero`
3. **Click** "Connect to Xero"
4. **Authorize** (takes 30 seconds)
5. **Go back** to `/missing-attachments`

## 📊 Token Status Summary:

Out of 41 companies in the database:
- ✅ **3 companies** have valid tokens (Companies: 7, 41, 54)
- ❌ **38 companies** need to reconnect to Xero

## 💡 Why This Happens:

- Xero tokens expire after 60 days
- Most companies haven't connected in a long time
- Companies 7, 41, and 54 connected recently (6-11 days ago)
- Their tokens are fresh and valid!

## 🚀 Recommendation:

**Use Company ID 54 ("Demo Company (Global)")** - It's clearly marked as a demo company and has valid tokens!
